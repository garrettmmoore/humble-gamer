# Application
Hello! Welcome to Humble Gamer! This full-stack site allows users to view and leave comments on the latest video game news articles.

# Built With

Humble Gamer is built using JavaScript, node.js, and Express to query and route data, BootStrap, CSS, and Handlebars to generate the HTML. The news articles are scraped from the video game news site 'Polygon' using Cheerio. The application is currently deployed to Heroku and uses the popular noSQL Database MongoDB.

Node Packages Used: express, express-handlebars, mongoose, body-parser, cheerio, and request

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
1. Create a GitHub repo for this assignment and clone it to your computer.
2. Heroku Account:
    1. Create a Heroku account for deployment here https://www.heroku.com/ .
3. Install MongoDB
    1. For installation assistance visit https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/ .

## Installing
1. Open up the project and run npm install.
2. The following npm packages should now be installed:
    1. express
    2. mongoose
    3. express-handlebars
    4. body-parser
    5. cheerio
    6. request

## Deployment
1. In order to deploy the project to Heroku, you need to set up an mLab provision. mLab is a remote MongoDB database that Heroku supports natively.
    1. Create a Heroku app in your project directory.
    2. Run 'heroku addons:create mongolab' in your Terminal/Bash window:
2. You'll need to find the URI string that connects Mongoose to mLab. Run this command to retrieve that string:
    1. 'heroku config | grep MONGODB_URI'
3. When youâ€™re ready to connect Mongoose with your remote database, simply paste the URI string as the lone argument of your mongoose.connect() function.
